<p>
Two players are playing a game. When the game starts, each player holds a paper with two positive integers written on it.<br>
They make moves in turn. At a player's turn, the player can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>pick a number on the player's own paper and change it by removing a $0$ from its <strong class="tooltip">ternary expansion<span class="tooltiptext">base-$3$ expansion</span></strong>;</li>
<li>pick a number on the opponent's paper and change it by removing a $1$ from its ternary expansion;</li>
<li>pick a number on either paper and change it by removing a $2$ from its ternary expansion.</li></ul>
<p>
The player that is unable to make a move loses.<br>
Leading zeros are not allowed in any ternary expansion; in particular nobody can make a move on the number $0$.</p>

<p>
An initial setting is called <dfn>fair</dfn> if whichever player moves first will lose the game if both play optimally.</p>

<p>
For example, if initially the integers on the paper of the first player are $1, 5$ and those on the paper of the second player are $2, 4$, then this is a fair initial setting, which we can denote as $(1, 5 \mid 2, 4)$.<br>
Note that the order of the two integers on a paper does not matter, but the order of the two papers matter.<br>
Thus $(5, 1 \mid 4, 2)$ is considered the same as $(1, 5 \mid 2, 4)$, while $(2, 4 \mid 1, 5)$ is a different initial setting.</p>

<p>
Let $F(N)$ be the number of fair initial settings where each initial number does not exceed $N$.<br>
For example, $F(5) = 21$.</p>

<p>
Find $F(10^5)$.</p>
