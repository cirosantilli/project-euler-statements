A <strong>round number</strong> is a number that ends with one or more zeros in a given base.</p>

<p>
Let us define the <dfn>roundness</dfn> of a number $n$ in base $b$ as the number of zeros at the end of the base $b$ representation of $n$.<br>
For example, $20$ has roundness $2$ in base $2$, because the base $2$ representation of $20$ is $10100$, which ends with $2$ zeros.</p>

<p>
Also define $R(n)$, the <dfn>total roundness</dfn> of a number $n$, as the sum of the roundness of $n$ in base $b$ for all $b &gt; 1$.<br>
For example, $20$ has roundness $2$ in base $2$ and roundness $1$ in base $4$, $5$, $10$, $20$, hence we get $R(20)=6$.<br>
You are also given $R(10!) = 312$.</p>

<p>
Find $R(10\,000\,000!)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p>
