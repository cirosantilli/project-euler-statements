<p>
There is a plane on which all points are initially white, except three red points and two blue points.<br>
On each day, every line passing through a red point and a blue point is constructed. Then every white point, where two different such lines meet, turns blue.</p>

<p>
Let $g(n)$ be the maximal possible number of blue points after $n$ days.</p>

<p>
For example, $g(1)=8$ and $g(2)=28$.</p>

<p>
Find $g(16)$.</p>
