<p>The <b>hyperbolic plane</b>, represented by the <b>open unit disc</b>, can be tiled by heptagons. Every tile is a hyperbolic heptagon (i.e. it has seven edges which are segments of <b>geodesics</b> in the hyperbolic plane) and every vertex is shared by three tiles.<br>
Please refer to <a href="problem=972">Problem 972</a> for some of the definitions.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows an illustration of this tiling.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0979_heptagons_frog.png?1767857959" alt="0979_heptagons_frog.png" width="500"></div>

<p>Now, a hyperbolic frog starts from one of the heptagons, as shown in the diagram. At each step, it can jump to any one of the seven adjacent tiles.</p>

<p>Define $F(n)$ to be the number of paths the frog can trace so that after $n$ steps it lands back at the starting tile.<br>
You are given $F(4) = 119$.</p>

<p>Find $F(20)$.</p>
