The total number of prime factors of $n$, counted with multiplicity, is denoted $\Omega(n)$.<br>
For example, $\Omega(12)=3$, counting the factor $2$ twice, and the factor $3$ once.</p>

<p>
Define $D(n, m)$ to be the sum of all divisors $d$ of $n$ where $\Omega(d)$ is divisible by $m$. <br>
For example, $D(24, 3)=1+8+12=21$.</p>

<p>
The <b>superfactorial</b> of $n$, often written as $n\$$, is defined as the product of the first $n$ factorials:
$$n\$=1!\times 2! \times\cdots\times n!$$
The <b>superduperfactorial</b> of $n$, we write as $n\bigstar$, is defined as the product of the first $n$ superfactorials:
$$n\bigstar=1\$ \times 2\$ \times\cdots\times n\$ $$
