<p>In the classical game of <b>Nim</b> two players take turns removing stones from piles. A player may remove any positive number of stones from a single pile. If there are no remaining stones, the next player to move loses.</p>

<p>In Factorisation Nim the initial position of the game is chosen according to the prime factorisation of a given natural number $n$ by setting a pile for each prime factor, including multiplicity. For example, if $n=12=2 \times 2 \times 3$ the game starts with three piles: two piles with two stones and one pile with three stones.</p>

<p>It can be verified that the first player to move loses for $n=1$ and for $n=70$, assuming both players play optimally.</p>

<p>Let $S(N)$ be the sum of $n$ for $1 \le n \le N$ such that the first player to move loses, assuming both players play optimally. You are given $S(10) = 14$ and $S(100) = 455$.</p>

<p>Find $S(10^{14})$. Give your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p>
