<p>
Two players A and B are playing a variant of Nim.<br>
At the beginning, there are several piles of stones. Each pile is either at the side of A or at the side of B. The piles are unordered.</p>

<p>
They make moves in turn. At a player's turn, the player can</p>
<ul>
<li>either choose a pile on the opponent's side and remove one stone from that pile;</li>
<li>or choose a pile on their own side and remove the whole pile.</li></ul>
<p>The winner is the player who removes the last stone.</p>

<p>
Let $E(N)$ be the number of initial settings with at most $N$ stones such that, whoever plays first, A always has a winning strategy.</p>

<p>
For example $E(4) = 9$; the settings are:
</p>
<div class="center"><table class="grid center"><tr><th>Nr.</th>
  <th>Piles at the side of A</th>
  <th>Piles at the side of B</th>
</tr><tr><td>1</td>
  <td>$4$</td>
  <td>none</td>
</tr><tr><td>2</td>
  <td>$1, 3$</td>
