<p>A permutation of $\{2,3,\ldots,n\}$ is a rearrangement of these numbers. A <i>coprime permutation</i> is a rearrangement such that all pairs of adjacent numbers are coprime.</p>

<p>Let $P(n)$ be the number of coprime permutations of $\{2,3,\ldots,n\}$.</p>

<p>For example, $P(4)=2$ as there are two coprime permutations, $(2,3,4)$ and $(4,3,2)$. You are also given $P(10)=576$.</p>

<p>Find $P(34)$ and give your answer modulo $83\,456\,729$.</p>
