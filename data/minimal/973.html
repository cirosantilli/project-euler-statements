<p>
A game is played with $n$ cards.
At the start the cards are dealt out onto a table to get $n$ piles of size one.</p>

<p>
Each round proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a pile at random and pick it up.</li>
<li>Randomly choose a pile from the table and add the top card of the picked-up pile to it.</li>
<li>Redistribute any remaining cards from the picked-up pile by dealing them into new single-card piles.</li></ol>

<p>
The game ends when all cards are in a single pile.</p>

<p>
At the end of each round a score is obtained by bitwise-XORing the size of each pile. The score is summed across the rounds. Let $X(n)$ be the expected total score at the end of the game.</p>

<p>
You are given $X(2) = 2$, $X(4) = 14$ and $X(10) = 1418$.</p>

<p>
Find $X(10^4)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9+7$.</p>
