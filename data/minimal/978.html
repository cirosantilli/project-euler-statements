In this problem we consider a <b>random walk</b> on the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, in which our position at time $t$ is denoted as $X_t$.
</p>
<p>
At time $0$ we start at position $0$. That is, $X_0=0$.<br>
At time $1$ we jump to position $1$. That is, $X_1=1$.<br>
Thereafter, at time $t=2,3,\dots$ we make a jump of size $|X_{t-2}|$ in either the positive or negative direction, with probability $1/2$ each way. If $X_{t-2}=0$ we stay put at time $t$.
</p>
<p>
At $t=5$ we find our position $X_5$ has the following distribution:
$$
X_5=\begin{cases}
-1\quad&amp;\text{with probability }3/8\\
1\quad&amp;\text{with probability }3/8\\
3\quad&amp;\text{with probability }1/8\\
5\quad&amp;\text{with probability }1/8\\
\end{cases}
$$
The <b>standard deviation</b> $\sigma$ of a <b>random variable</b> $X$ with <b>mean</b> $\mu$ is defined as
$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[X^2]-\mu^2}
$$
Furthermore the <b>skewness</b> of $X$ is defined as
$$
\text{Skew}(X)=\mathbb{E}\biggl[\Bigl(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\Bigr)^3\biggr]
$$
For $X_5$, which has mean $1$ and standard deviation $2$, we find $\text{Skew}(X_5)=0.75$. You are also given $\text{Skew}(X_{10})\approx2.50997097$.
</p>
<p>
Find $\text{Skew}(X_{50})$. Give your answer rounded to eight digits after the decimal point.
