# Angular Bisector and Tangent 2

Given is an integer sided triangle $ABC$ with $BC \le AC \le AB$.  
$k$ is the angular bisector of angle $ACB$.  
$m$ is the tangent at $C$ to the circumscribed circle of $ABC$.  
$n$ is a line parallel to $m$ through $B$.  
The intersection of $n$ and $k$ is called $E$.

How many triangles $ABC$ with a perimeter not exceeding $1\,000\,000$ exist such that $CE$ has integral length?

**Note**: This problem is a more difficult version of [Problem 296](problem=296). Please pay close attention to the differences between the two statements.
