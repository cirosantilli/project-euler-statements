# Champernowne's Constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
$$0.12345678910{\color{red}\mathbf 1}112131415161718192021\cdots$$

It can be seen that the $12$th digit of the fractional part is $1$.

If $d\_n$ represents the $n$th digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
$$d\_1 \times d\_{10} \times d\_{100} \times d\_{1000} \times d\_{10000} \times d\_{100000} \times d\_{1000000}$$
