# Finding Triangles

A sequence $(a\_n)\_{n \ge 0}$ starts with $a\_0 = 3$ and for each $n \ge 0$,

* if $a\_n$ is a **triangle numberA triangle number is a number of the form $m(m + 1)/2$ for some integer $m$.**, then $a\_{n + 1} = a\_n + 1$;
* otherwise, $a\_{n + 1} = 2a\_n - a\_{n - 1} + 1$.

The sequence begins:
$${\color{red}3}, 4, {\color{red}6}, 7, 9, 12, 16, {\color{red}21}, 22, 24, 27, 31, {\color{red}36}, 37, 39, 42, \dots$$
where triangle numbers are marked red.

The $10$th triangle number in the sequence is $a\_{2964} = 1439056$.  
Find the index $n$ such that $a\_n$ is the $70$th triangle number in the sequence.
