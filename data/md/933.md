# Paper Cutting

Starting with one piece of integer-sized rectangle paper, two players make moves in turn.  
A valid move consists of choosing one piece of paper and cutting it **both** horizontally and vertically, so that it becomes four pieces of smaller rectangle papers, all of which are integer-sized.  
The player that does not have a valid move loses the game.

Let $C(w, h)$ be the number of winning moves for the first player, when the original paper has size $w \times h$. For example, $C(5,3)=4$, with the four winning moves shown below.

Also write $\displaystyle D(W, H) = \sum\_{w = 2}^W\sum\_{h = 2}^H C(w, h)$. You are given that $D(12, 123) = 327398$.

Find $D(123, 1234567)$.
