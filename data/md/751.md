# Concatenation Coincidence

A non-decreasing sequence of integers $a\_n$ can be generated from any positive real value $\theta$ by the following procedure:
$$\begin{align}
\begin{split}
b\_1 &= \theta \\
b\_n &= \left\lfloor b\_{n-1} \right\rfloor \left(b\_{n-1} - \left\lfloor b\_{n-1} \right\rfloor + 1\right)~~~\forall ~ n \geq 2 \\
a\_n &= \left\lfloor b\_{n} \right\rfloor
\end{split}
\end{align}$$
Where $\left\lfloor \cdot \right\rfloor$ is the floor function.

For example, $\theta=2.956938891377988...$ generates the Fibonacci sequence: $2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$

The *concatenation* of a sequence of positive integers $a\_n$ is a real value denoted $\tau$ constructed by concatenating the elements of the sequence after the decimal point, starting at $a\_1$: $a\_1.a\_2a\_3a\_4...$

For example, the Fibonacci sequence constructed from $\theta=2.956938891377988...$ yields the concatenation $\tau=2.3581321345589...$ Clearly, $\tau \neq \theta$ for this value of $\theta$.

Find the only value of $\theta$ for which the generated sequence starts at $a\_1=2$ and the concatenation of the generated sequence equals the original value: $\tau = \theta$. Give your answer rounded to $24$ places after the decimal point.
