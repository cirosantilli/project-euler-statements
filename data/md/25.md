# $1000$-digit Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> $F\_n = F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$, where $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 = 1$.

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$\begin{align}
F\_1 &= 1\\
F\_2 &= 1\\
F\_3 &= 2\\
F\_4 &= 3\\
F\_5 &= 5\\
F\_6 &= 8\\
F\_7 &= 13\\
F\_8 &= 21\\
F\_9 &= 34\\
F\_{10} &= 55\\
F\_{11} &= 89\\
F\_{12} &= 144
\end{align}$$

The $12$th term, $F\_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
