# Subsequence of Thue-Morse Sequence

The **Thue-Morse sequence** $\{T\_n\}$ is a binary sequence satisfying:

* $T\_0 = 0$
* $T\_{2n} = T\_n$
* $T\_{2n + 1} = 1 - T\_n$

The first several terms of $\{T\_n\}$ are given as follows:  
$01101001{\color{red}10010}1101001011001101001\cdots$

We define $\{A\_n\}$ as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in $\{T\_n\}$.  
For example, the decimal number $18$ is expressed as $10010$ in binary. $10010$ appears in $\{T\_n\}$ ($T\_8$ to $T\_{12}$), so $18$ is an element of $\{A\_n\}$.  
The decimal number $14$ is expressed as $1110$ in binary. $1110$ never appears in $\{T\_n\}$, so $14$ is not an element of $\{A\_n\}$.

The first several terms of $\{A\_n\}$ are given as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $n$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $\cdots$ |
| $A\_n$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $13$ | $18$ | $\cdots$ |

We can also verify that $A\_{100} = 3251$ and $A\_{1000} = 80852364498$.

Find the last $9$ digits of $\sum \limits\_{k = 1}^{18} A\_{10^k}$.
