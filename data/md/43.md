# Sub-string Divisibility

The number, $1406357289$, is a $0$ to $9$ pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits $0$ to $9$ in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let $d\_1$ be the $1$st digit, $d\_2$ be the $2$nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

* $d\_2d\_3d\_4=406$ is divisible by $2$
* $d\_3d\_4d\_5=063$ is divisible by $3$
* $d\_4d\_5d\_6=635$ is divisible by $5$
* $d\_5d\_6d\_7=357$ is divisible by $7$
* $d\_6d\_7d\_8=572$ is divisible by $11$
* $d\_7d\_8d\_9=728$ is divisible by $13$
* $d\_8d\_9d\_{10}=289$ is divisible by $17$

Find the sum of all $0$ to $9$ pandigital numbers with this property.
