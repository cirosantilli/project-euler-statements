# SOP and POS

Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $E\_n$ be the set of $n$-tuples of strictly positive integers.

For $u = (u\_1, \cdots, u\_n)$ and $v = (v\_1, \cdots, v\_n)$ two elements of $E\_n$, we define:

* the Sum Of Products of $u$ and $v$, denoted by $\langle u, v\rangle$, as the sum $\displaystyle\sum\_{i = 1}^n u\_i v\_i$;
* the Product Of Sums of $u$ and $v$, denoted by $u \star v$, as the product $\displaystyle\prod\_{i = 1}^n (u\_i + v\_i)$.

Let $R\_n(M)$ be the sum of $u \star v$ over all ordered pairs $(u, v)$ in $E\_n$ such that $\langle u, v\rangle = M$.  
For example: $R\_1(10) = 36$, $R\_2(100) = 1873044$, $R\_2(100!) \equiv 446575636 \bmod 10^9 + 7$.

Find $R\_6(10000!)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9+7$.
