# Khinchin Exceptions

An irrational number $x$ can be uniquely expressed as a **continued fraction** $[a\_0; a\_1,a\_2,a\_3,\dots]$:
$$
x=a\_{0}+\cfrac{1}{a\_1+\cfrac{1}{a\_2+\cfrac{1}{a\_3+{\_\ddots}}}}
$$where $a\_0$ is an integer and $a\_1,a\_2,a\_3,\dots$ are positive integers.

Define $k\_j(x)$ to be the **geometric mean** of $a\_1,a\_2,\dots,a\_j$.  
 That is, $k\_j(x)=(a\_1a\_2 \cdots a\_j)^{1/j}$.  
 Also define $k\_\infty(x)=\lim\_{j\to \infty} k\_j(x)$.

Khinchin proved that **almost all** irrational numbers $x$ have the same value of $k\_\infty(x)\approx2.685452\dots$ known as **Khinchin's constant**. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.

For $n\geq 0$ define
$$\rho\_n = \sum\_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{2^{2^i}}
$$For example $\rho\_2$, with continued fraction beginning $[3; 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 1, 3,\dots]$, has $k\_\infty(\rho\_2)\approx2.059767$.

Find the geometric mean of $k\_{\infty}(\rho\_n)$ for $0\leq n\leq 50$, giving your answer rounded to six digits after the decimal point.
