# Sliders

You probably know the game **Fifteen Puzzle**. Here, instead of numbered tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.

A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (**S**), by the sequence **LULUR** we reach the configuration (**E**):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (**S**) | 0244_start.gif | , (**E**) | 0244_example.gif |

For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):

$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{checksum} &= 0\\
\mathrm{checksum} &= (\mathrm{checksum} \times 243 + m\_1) \bmod 100\,000\,007\\
\mathrm{checksum} &= (\mathrm{checksum} \times 243 + m\_2) \bmod 100\,000\,007\\
\cdots &\\
\mathrm{checksum} &= (\mathrm{checksum} \times 243 + m\_n) \bmod 100\,000\,007
\end{align}$$
where $m\_k$ is the ASCII value of the $k$th letter in the move sequence and the ASCII values for the moves are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **L** | 76 |
| **R** | 82 |
| **U** | 85 |
| **D** | 68 |

For the sequence **LULUR** given above, the checksum would be $19761398$.

Now, starting from configuration (**S**),
find all shortest ways to reach configuration (**T**).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (**S**) | 0244_start.gif | , (**T**) | 0244_target.gif |

What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?
