# Four Representations Using Squares

Consider the number $3600$. It is very special, because

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
3600 &= 48^2 + &&36^2\\
3600 &= 20^2 + 2 \times &&40^2\\
3600 &= 30^2 + 3 \times &&30^2\\
3600 &= 45^2 + 7 \times &&15^2
\end{alignat}$$

Similarly, we find that $88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2 \times 54^2 = 283^2 + 3 \times 52^2 = 197^2 + 7 \times 84^2$.

In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.
We are interested in the numbers $n$ which admit representations of all of the following four types:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
n &= a\_1^2 + && b\_1^2\\
n &= a\_2^2 + 2 && b\_2^2\\
n &= a\_3^2 + 3 && b\_3^2\\
n &= a\_7^2 + 7 && b\_7^2,
\end{alignat}$$

where the $a\_k$ and $b\_k$ are positive integers.

There are $75373$ such numbers that do not exceed $10^7$.  
How many such numbers are there that do not exceed $2 \times 10^9$?
