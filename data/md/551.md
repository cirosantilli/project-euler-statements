# Sum of Digits Sequence

Let $a\_0, a\_1, \dots$ be an integer sequence defined by:

* $a\_0 = 1$;
* for $n \ge 1$, $a\_n$ is the sum of the digits of all preceding terms.

The sequence starts with $1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 28, 38, 49, \dots$  
You are given $a\_{10^6} = 31054319$.

Find $a\_{10^{15}}$.
