# Tribonacci Non-divisors

The sequence $1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201, \dots$  
is defined by $T\_1 = T\_2 = T\_3 = 1$ and $T\_n = T\_{n - 1} + T\_{n - 2} + T\_{n - 3}$.

It can be shown that $27$ does not divide any terms of this sequence.  
In fact, $27$ is the first odd number with this property.

Find the $124$th odd number that does not divide any terms of the above sequence.
