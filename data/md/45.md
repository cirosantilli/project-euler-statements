# Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Triangle |  | $T\_n=n(n+1)/2$ |  | $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots$ |
| Pentagonal |  | $P\_n=n(3n - 1)/2$ |  | $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots$ |
| Hexagonal |  | $H\_n=n(2n - 1)$ |  | $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots$ |

It can be verified that $T\_{285} = P\_{165} = H\_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
