# Pseudo Geometric Sequences

We define a pseudo-geometric sequence to be a finite sequence $a\_0, a\_1, \dotsc, a\_n$ of positive integers, satisfying the following conditions:

* $n \geq 4$, i.e. the sequence has at least $5$ terms.
* $0 \lt a\_0 \lt a\_1 \lt \cdots \lt a\_n$, i.e. the sequence is strictly increasing.
* $| a\_i^2 - a\_{i - 1}a\_{i + 1} | \le 2$ for $1 \le i \le n-1$.

Let $G(N)$ be the number of different pseudo-geometric sequences whose terms do not exceed $N$.  
For example, $G(6) = 4$, as the following $4$ sequences give a complete list:

$1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \qquad 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 \qquad 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \qquad 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ 

Also, $G(10) = 26$, $G(100) = 4710$ and $G(1000) = 496805$.

Find $G(10^{18})$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
