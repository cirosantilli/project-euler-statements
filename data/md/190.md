# Maximising a Weighted Product

Let $S\_m = (x\_1, x\_2, \dots , x\_m)$ be the $m$-tuple of positive real numbers with $x\_1 + x\_2 + \cdots + x\_m = m$ for which $P\_m = x\_1 \cdot x\_2^2 \cdot \cdots \cdot x\_m^m$ is maximised.

For example, it can be verified that $\lfloor P\_{10}\rfloor = 4112$ ($\lfloor \, \rfloor$ is the integer part function).

Find $\sum\limits\_{m = 2}^{15} \lfloor P\_m \rfloor$.
