# Bitwise-OR Operations on Random Integers

Let $y\_0, y\_1, y\_2, \dots$ be a sequence of random unsigned $32$-bit integers  
(i.e. $0 \le y\_i \lt 2^{32}$, every value equally likely).

For the sequence $x\_i$ the following recursion is given:

* $x\_0 = 0$ and
* $x\_i = x\_{i - 1} \boldsymbol \mid y\_{i - 1}$, for $i \gt 0$. ($\boldsymbol \mid$ is the bitwise-OR operator).

It can be seen that eventually there will be an index $N$ such that $x\_i = 2^{32} - 1$ (a bit-pattern of all ones) for all $i \ge N$.

Find the expected value of $N$.   
Give your answer rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.
