# Pentagon Numbers

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P\_n=n(3n-1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
$$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, \dots$$

It can be seen that $P\_4 + P\_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P\_8$. However, their difference, $70 - 22 = 48$, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P\_j$ and $P\_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = |P\_k - P\_j|$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?
