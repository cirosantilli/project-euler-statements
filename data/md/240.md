# Top Dice

There are $1111$ ways in which five $6$-sided dice (sides numbered $1$ to $6$) can be rolled so that the top three sum to $15$. Some examples are:
  
  
$D\_1,D\_2,D\_3,D\_4,D\_5 = 4,3,6,3,5$
  
$D\_1,D\_2,D\_3,D\_4,D\_5 = 4,3,3,5,6$
  
$D\_1,D\_2,D\_3,D\_4,D\_5 = 3,3,3,6,6$
  
$D\_1,D\_2,D\_3,D\_4,D\_5 = 6,6,3,3,3$
  
  
In how many ways can twenty $12$-sided dice (sides numbered $1$ to $12$) be rolled so that the top ten sum to $70$?
