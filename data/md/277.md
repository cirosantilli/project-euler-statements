# A Modified Collatz Sequence

A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value $a\_1$ in the following way:

$a\_{n+1} = \, \,\, \frac {a\_n} 3 \quad$ if $a\_n$ is divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".

$a\_{n+1} = \frac {4 a\_n+2} 3 \, \,$ if $a\_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".

$a\_{n+1} = \frac {2 a\_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a\_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".

The sequence terminates when some $a\_n = 1$.

Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.  
For instance if $a\_1=231$, then the sequence $\{a\_n\}=\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\}$ corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".

Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence "DdDddUUdDD....".  
For instance, if $a\_1=1004064$, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.  
In fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a\_1 > 10^6$ that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.

What is the smallest $a\_1 > 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?
